My data visualization of self-trust through time
September 6, 2018 through December 6, 2018

I define trust as the reliability, truth, ability, or strength I had in myself. This visualization is about my internal perceptions of trust throughout 3 months of quantitative data.
    
Through reflection, I realized a correlation to explain my trust (or lack): The amount of trust I have in myself doing something correlates to the amount of time I spend doing it.  Therefore, the more I do something, the more trust I have in myself doing it. 

Using the data, I created visualizations for how I spent my time every week, and summed that up for each of the months: September, October, November, and December.  
		
<h2> How does this work? </h2> 
  
I gathered all my data about how my time was being spent throughout the 3 months: 4 Google Calendars, Paycom, ClassPass, Tigerlily Holistic Appointment website. I also gathered all my data from my monthly self-trust assessments from a concurrent leadership course. 

I then categorized the data and saw these categories emerged for how my time was spent: time spent at school, time spent at work, time participating in self-care (paid yoga classes and acupuncture sessions). I then cross-referenced with my daily journal entries.

From my journal entries, I saw that I was building trust (confidence) in my school work and professional duties; however, was not building trusting in my own personal life at the same rate. Through this data I realized that this was likely because I was not prioritizing that aspect of my life in the same way— by not spending even half the amount of time participating in self-care.

These visuals show the comparison of how my time was being spent. However, that was only half of the data. Cross-referencing with my journal entries, taught me that the self-trust assessments held truth to how my trust was moving over these months. 

<b> <h2> Why these visuals?</font> </h2> </b>
I chose the small multiples style of data visualization to clearly visually compare how my time was spent. The differing color circles were to easily represent school (in blue), work (in green), self care (in orange), and self-trust assessment (in red.) Circles were chosen because of the symbolism in their free movement, which allows me to endure and be connected.

I chose to fill the circle of trust entirely to represent the solidity. The location of the circle serves as my accountability line for when and how I started to trust myself entirely throughout the month.

NOTE: Due to the small nature of the graphs, if a circle is represented it is either at or above 0. All numbers are positive.

<b> <h2> What did this all mean together? What is next?</h2> </b> 

It took a significant amount of hours each month in order for me to build trust in myself. For my hours spent at work and in school I was able to build trust and continue to work after having achieving that in the space. For self-care and trusting myself internally I did not quite get there. All of this data has shown me that moving forward I should find more ways to prioritize self care and find more balance in how I spent my time.

Collecting this data also gave me the ability to reflect, quantify and see for myself what and how I was doing on a daily basis. This allowed me to learn and compare my emotional journey and understand areas of my life where I could focus moving forward to trust myself more. 
<div> <p> <b> <h3> <font color="gray"> What’s next?</font> </h3> </b> Representing the entire month of December in this data set and continuing this throughout the next year to see how my trust will be visualized over a larger period of time. I would also like to add more room for narrative and other aspects of my reflection into this data set, like specifically who I spent time with and how that affected the journey.     </p>
